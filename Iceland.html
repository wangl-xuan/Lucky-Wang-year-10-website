    <h2>Iceland!!</h2>
    <p>Celand, an island country located in the North Atlantic Ocean,
        is also my favorite place and the place I most want to go.
        What attracts me the most about Iceland is the glaciers
        and snow capped mountains on the island.</p>
    <p>Here is the location of Iceland on the map. It is located in the North Atlantic Ocean, between
        Greenland and Norway. It is a Nordic island country
        with a small population of about 370,000 people.</p>
